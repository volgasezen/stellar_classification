# Stellar Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository holds code and model checkpoints for reproducing the "Application of convolutional neural networks for stellar spectral classification" paper by Kausal Sharma et al. (2020) https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stz3100

Preprocessed CFLIB and SDSS MaSTAR spectra as well as CFLIB labels can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IFa3CnwQeQ3jHwlCAIEJGhArZjfkyeml?usp=sharing).
